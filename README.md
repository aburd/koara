This page uses ver. Bootstrap 3.3.2 for most of the design with layout and custom css style created by me. The RSS feed uses the zRSSfeed Javascript which is free to download here: http://www.zazar.net/developers/jquery/zrssfeed/

The Map in the access section is made using the Javascript Google Maps API. Although you can use static maps, I suggest trying out the Javascript API with generous examples provided by google here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/
